Action-Source
=============

Issue tracker for Action: Source

Please use this repository to report bugs and request features for the game Action: Source.

Action: Source is produced by **Lights Camera Action! Studios**

This README is heavily based on [Valve Software's Source 1 Games Issue Tracker README](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games)

Conduct
-------

There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions. While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.

Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with Action: Source. As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested. Patience is always appreciated.

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter a bug while using Action: Source, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/shmopaloppa/Action-Source/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;
- steps for reproducing the issue; and
- your system information (for crash, graphical, or audio issues).

Please place logs either in a code block ([go here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

### System information

Your system information must include:
- your Linux distro or OS version
- your Desktop/Window Manager (Linux only)
- your Graphics card info (manufacturer, card version), any and all graphics driver versions
- anything else that you think may be useful (mouse/keyboard, filesystem type, etc).

The preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (`Help -> System Information`).

Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`.
Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

Feature Requests
-------------------

If you are asking for a new feature or enhancement for a game, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/shmopaloppa/Action-Source/issues) to see if it has already been asked for. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has been asked for, go ahead and put your 2 cents in for it in the existing entry.

If it has not been asked for, create a new issue with at least the following information:

 - A clear description of what exactly you want
 - Justification as to why this is something that is needed
 - What priority this feature should be and why

Remember that just because you ask for a feature improvement doesn't mean we'll get to it.  We're mostly going to be focused on a stable release with polished core gameplay elements.  That being said, it does make a difference to know what you want here.  Be clear.  Be concise.
